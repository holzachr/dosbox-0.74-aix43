     cc [ option | inputfile ]...
     c89 [ option | inputfile ]...
     xlc128 [ option | inputfile ]...

  Description:
     The xlC and related commands compile C and C++ source files.
     They also processes assembler source files and object files. Unless the
     -c option is specified, xlC calls the linkage editor to produce a
     single object file. Input files may be any of the following:
       1. file name with .c suffix: C source file
       2. file name with .i suffix: preprocessed C or C++ source file
       3. file name with .o suffix: object file for ld command
       4. file name with .s suffix: assembler source file
       5. file name with .so suffix: shared object file

  Options:
     Options can be flag options or keyword options:

       1. Flag options:

        -#        Display language processing commands but do
                  not invoke them; output goes to stdout.
        -bdynamic, -bstatic
                  Determines which types of library files are searched by
                  the linkage editor.
        -brtl     Tells the linkage editor to accept both .so and .a
                  library file types.
        -B<prefix>
                  Construct alternate compiler/assembler/linkage editor
                  program names. <prefix> is added to the beginning of
                  the standard program names.
        -c        Do not send object files to the linkage editor.
        -C        Write comments to output when doing preprocessing,
                  used with -E and -P.
        -D<name>[=<def>]
                  Define <name> as in #define directive. If <def> is
                  not specified, 1 is assumed.
        -E        Preprocess but do not compile; output goes to stdout
        -f<filename>
                  Passes to the linkage editor the filename of a file
                  containing a list of input files to be processed.
        -F<x>[:<stanza>]
                  Use alternate configuration file <x> with optional
                  <stanza>. If <stanza> is not specified, the assumed stanza
                  is the name of the command used to invoke the compiler.
        -g        Produce information for the debugger.
        -G        Tells the linkage editor to create a dynamic library.
        -I<dir>   Search in directory <dir> for include files that
                  do not start with an absolute path.
        -l<key>   Search the specified library file,
                  where <key> selects the file lib<key>.a.
        -L<dir>   Search in directory <dir> for files specified by -l<key>.
        -ma       Generate inline calls to the "alloca" function as if
                  "#pragma alloca" directives were in the source file.
        -M        Generate information to be included in a "make"
                  description file; output goes to .u file.
        -o<name>  Name the executable file <name> instead of a.out.
                  When used with the -c option and one source file,
                  name the object file <name> instead of filename.o.
                  If <name> is the name of a directory, files generated by
                  the compiler will be placed into that directory.
        -O        Optimize generated code.
        -O2       Same as -O.
        -O3       Perform some memory and compile time intensive
                  optimizations in addition to those executed with -O2.
                  The -O3 specific optimizations have the potential to
                  alter the semantics of a user's program.
                  The compiler guards against these optimizations at -O2
                  and the option -qstrict is provided at -O3 to turn off
                  these aggressive optimizations.
        -O4       Equivalent to -O3 -qipa with automatic generation of
                  architecture and tuning option ideal for that platform.
        -O5       Equivalent to -O3 -qipa=level=2 with automatic
                  generation of architecture and tuning option ideal for
                  that platform.
        -p        Generate profiling support code.  Same as -qprofile=p.
        -pg       Generate profiling support code including BSD
                  profiling support.  Same as -qprofile=pg.
        -P        Preprocess but do not compile; output goes to .i file.
        -Q<x>, -qinline<x>
                  Inline all appropriate functions where x can be
                  one of the following:
                    !       Not inline any function (equivalent to -qnoinline)
                    =<lc>   Inline if number of source statement in
                            function is less than the number specified
                            in <lc>.
                    -<nm>   Not inline function listed by names in <nm>
                    +<nm>   Attempt to inline function listed by names
                            in <nm>.
        -r        Produce the output file without linking any library.
        -S        Produce a .s file for any source file processed by the
                  compiler.
        -t<x>     Apply prefix from the -B option to the specified program <x>,
                  where x can be one or more of the following:
                    a = assembler
                    b = compiler backend
                    c = compiler frontend
                    i = compiler inliner
                    I = inter-procedural analysis - compile phase
                    l = linkage editor
                    L = inter-procedural analysis - link phase.
                    p = preprocessor
        -U<name>  Undefine name as in #undef directive.
        -v        Displays language processing commands as they
                  are invoked by xlc; output goes to stdout.
        -V        Displays commands as they are invoked by xlC;
                  output goes to stdout.
        -w        Suppress informational, language-level, and
                  warning messages.
        -W<x,y>   Give the options <y> to the compiler program <x>
                  where x can be one or more of the following:
                    <a,b,c,f,I,l,L,p>
        -y<x>     Specify compile-time rounding of constant floating-point
                  expressions, where <x> can be one of the following:
                    m = round toward minus infinity
                    n = round to nearest
                    p = round toward positive infinity
                    z = round toward zero.

       2. Keyword options:

          Keyword options are specified in one of the following ways:

          -q<option>
          -q<option>=<parameter>
          -q<option>=<parameter>:<parameter>

          where <option> is an option name and <parameter> is a
          parameter value.
          Keyword options with no parameters represent switches
          that may be either on or off. The keyword by itself turns
          the switch on, and the keyword preceded by the letters NO
          turns the switch off. For example, -qLIST tells the
          compiler to produce a listing and -qNOLIST tells the
          compiler not to produce a listing. If an option that
          represents a switch is set more than once, the compiler
          uses the last setting.

          Keyword option and parameter names may appear in either
          UPPER CASE or lower case letters in the xlc command.


          Options without parameters:

          32          Selects 32-bit compiler mode.
          64          Selects 64-bit compiler mode.
          ansialias   Use type-based aliasing during optimization.
          compact     Reduce code size where possible, at the expense
                      of execution speed.  Code size is reduced by
                      inhibiting optimizations that replicate or expand
                      code inline.
          cpluscmt    Permit "//" to introduce a comment that lasts
                      until the end of the current source line, as in C++.
          dbcs        String literals and comments can contain DBCS
                      characters (same as mbcs option).
          dbxextra    Generate symbol table information for unreferenced
                      variables. By default such information is not generated
                      thus reducing the size of the executable compiled with
                      the "-g" option.  Same as -qsymtab=unref.
          digraph     Allow special digraph
          dollar      Allow '$' as an identifier character
          dpcl        Generates symbols for tools based on the Dynamic
                      Probe Class Library (DPCL)
          extchk      Perform external name type-checking and function
                      call checking.
          fdpr        Collect information about programs for use with
                      the AIX fdpr (Feedback Directed Program Restructuring)
                      performance-tuning utility.
          flttrap     Generate instructions to trap floating-point
                      exceptions.
          fold        Specifies that constant floating-point expressions
                      are to be evaluated at compile time.
          fullpath    Specifies the path information stored for files when
                      you use "-g" and the symbolic debugger.
          funcsect    Place instructions for each function in a separate csect.
          heapdebug   Enables debug versions of memory management functions.
          hot         Determines whether or not to perform high-order
                      transformations on loops during optimization.
          idirfirst   Specify the search order for files included with
                      the #include "file_name" directive.  Use -qidirfirst
                      with the -Idirectory option.  If -qidirfirst option
                      is specified, the directories specified by the
                      -Idirectory option are searched before the directory
                      where the current file resides.
          ignerrno    Tell the optimizer that the program will never
                      refer to or set errno.  This allows additional
                      optimizations.
          inlglue     Generate fast external linkage by inlining the
                      code (pointer glue code) necessary at calls
                      via a function pointer and calls to external
                      procedures.
          largepage   Take advantage of 16M pages, which will allow for
                      reduced TLB entries and allow hardware prefetching
                      to be done more efficiently.
          ldbl128     Increase long double size from 64 to 128 bits.
          libansi     Assumes that all functions with the name of an
                      ANSI C library functions are in fact the system functions.

                      information for the debugger.
          list        Produce an object listing; output goes to .lst file.
          listopt     Display the settings of all options; output goes
                      to .lst file.
          longdouble  Increase long double size from 64 to 128 bits.
          longlit     Changes implicit type selection for integer constants in
                      64-bit mode.
          longlong    Allow long long integers.
          macpstr     Allow '\p' as the first character of a string constant
                      which will be replaced by the length in bytes.
          makedep     Creates an output file that contains targets suitable for
                      inclusion in a description file for the AIX make command.
          mbcs        String literals and comments can contain DBCS
                      characters (same as dbcs option).
          mkshrobj    Create a shared object from generated object files.
          noprint     Direct listing to /dev/null.
          nostdinc    Specify which files are included with the #include
                      "file_name" and #include <file_name> directives.
                      If -qnostdinc is specified, the /usr/include directory
                      is not searched.
          optimize    Same as O and O2. Perform optimization that is the
                      mix between speed and size.  (If -qnooptimize is
                      specified, it is equivalent to -qoptimize=0.)
          pascal      Accept and ignore the keyword 'pascal' as a
                      type modifier.
          pdf1, pdf2  Perform aggressive optimizations with profile
                      directed feedback.
          phsinfo     Produce compiler phase information; output goes to
                      stdout.
          proto       Assert that procedure call points agree
                      with their declarations even if the procedure has
                      not been prototyped. This allows the caller to
                      pass floating point arguments in floating point
                      registers instead of general purpose registers.
          report      Adds information to the listing file on the loop
                      transformations that have been carried out.
                      This option requires either -qhot or -qsmp
                      in order to have effect.
          ro          Put string literals in read only area.
          roconst     Put constant values in read only area.
          showinc     Include the source of all included files in the
                      source listing, if the SOURCE option is in effect.
          smallstack  Reduce the size of the stack frame, allowing better use
                      of a limited stack size.
          source      Produce a source listing; output goes to .lst file.
          srcmsg      Reconstruct source lines in error along with the
                      diagnostic messages in the stderr file.
          statsym     Adds user-defined, nonexternal names that have a
                      persistent storage class, such as initialized and
                      uninitialized static variables, to the name list
                      (the symbol table of xcoff objects).  Same as
                      -qsymtab=static.
          strict      Turns off aggressive optimizations which have the
                      potential to alter the semantics of a user's program.
                      This option also sets -qfloat=nofltint:norsqrt.
          strict_induction
                      Turns off induction variable optimizations
                      that have the potential to alter the semantics of a
                      user's program. The default is "nostrict_induction" at
                      -O2 or higher and "strict_induction" otherwise.
                      "nostrict_induction" is recomended if your program does
                      not have overflows or wrap arounds of loop induction
                      variables.
          syntaxonly  Causes the compiler to perform syntax checking without
                      generating an object file.
          threaded    Indicates to the compiler that the program will execute
                      in multi-threaded environment.
          tocmerge    Read from the file specified in -bImportfile linker
                      option and merge the address information to access
                      ranges of external addresses using a single Table Of
                      Content entry.
          upconv      Preserves the unsigned specification when performing
                      integral promotions.
          warn64      Enables checking for possible long-to-integer or
                      pointer-to-integer truncation.
          unwind      Enables stack unwinding.  The optimization prologue
                      tailoring reduces the number of saves and restores

                      1, 2, 4 or 8.
                      small denotes that either one, two, four or eight (valid
                      in 64-bit mode only) bytes of storage will be allocated
                      for enum variables based on the range of the enum
                      constants.
                      int is the default, and causes enum variables to be
                      treated as though they were of type signed int
                      depending on the range of the enum constants.
                      1 will cause enum variables to be packed into 1 byte.

                                     that are analyzed together.  Larger
                                     partitions may produce better analysis but
                                     require more storage.

          procimported=<name1>:<name2>: ...
                      Specify which functions are imported.  If no filenames
                      are specified, all invoked functions are assumed to be
                      defined outside the current file.  The last explicit
                      specification for a function takes precedence.

                      called are assumed to be unknown. This is the default
                      when no user options are specified. The last explicit
                      specification for a function takes precedence.

                      Controls acceptance of OpenMP directives and
                      automatic parallelization.  The auto and omp suboptions
                      are opposites. i.e. -qsmp=omp means strict adherance
                      to the OpenMP standard with no automatic parallelization.
                      [no]auto

                              and chunking are used for loops to which no
                              other scheduling algorithm has been explicitly
                              assigned in the source code.
                              Valid options for <sched_type> are:

                              parameter information.
                              This is the default when -g is NOT specified.
          tune=<option>
                      Specifies the architecture system for which the

  Description:
     The xlC and related commands compile C and C++ source files.
     They also processes assembler source files and object files. Unless the
     -c option is specified, xlC calls the linkage editor to produce a
     single object file. Input files may be any of the following:
       1. file name with .c suffix: C source file
       2. file name with .i suffix: preprocessed C or C++ source file
       3. file name with .o suffix: object file for ld command
       4. file name with .s suffix: assembler source file
       5. file name with .so suffix: shared object file

  Options:
     Options can be flag options or keyword options:

       1. Flag options:

        -#        Display language processing commands but do
                  not invoke them; output goes to stdout.
        -bdynamic, -bstatic
                  Determines which types of library files are searched by
                  the linkage editor.
        -brtl     Tells the linkage editor to accept both .so and .a
                  library file types.
        -B<prefix>
                  Construct alternate compiler/assembler/linkage editor
                  program names. <prefix> is added to the beginning of
                  the standard program names.
        -c        Do not send object files to the linkage editor.
        -C        Write comments to output when doing preprocessing,
                  used with -E and -P.
        -D<name>[=<def>]
                  Define <name> as in #define directive. If <def> is
                  not specified, 1 is assumed.
        -E        Preprocess but do not compile; output goes to stdout
        -f<filename>
                  Passes to the linkage editor the filename of a file
                  containing a list of input files to be processed.
        -F<x>[:<stanza>]
                  Use alternate configuration file <x> with optional
                  <stanza>. If <stanza> is not specified, the assumed stanza
                  is the name of the command used to invoke the compiler.
        -g        Produce information for the debugger.
        -G        Tells the linkage editor to create a dynamic library.
        -I<dir>   Search in directory <dir> for include files that
                  do not start with an absolute path.
        -l<key>   Search the specified library file,
                  where <key> selects the file lib<key>.a.
        -L<dir>   Search in directory <dir> for files specified by -l<key>.
        -ma       Generate inline calls to the "alloca" function as if
                  "#pragma alloca" directives were in the source file.
        -M        Generate information to be included in a "make"
                  description file; output goes to .u file.
        -o<name>  Name the executable file <name> instead of a.out.
                  When used with the -c option and one source file,
                  name the object file <name> instead of filename.o.
                  If <name> is the name of a directory, files generated by
                  the compiler will be placed into that directory.
        -O        Optimize generated code.
        -O2       Same as -O.
        -O3       Perform some memory and compile time intensive
                  optimizations in addition to those executed with -O2.
                  The -O3 specific optimizations have the potential to
                  alter the semantics of a user's program.
                  The compiler guards against these optimizations at -O2
                  and the option -qstrict is provided at -O3 to turn off
                  these aggressive optimizations.
        -O4       Equivalent to -O3 -qipa with automatic generation of
                  architecture and tuning option ideal for that platform.
        -O5       Equivalent to -O3 -qipa=level=2 with automatic
                  generation of architecture and tuning option ideal for
                  that platform.
        -p        Generate profiling support code.  Same as -qprofile=p.
        -pg       Generate profiling support code including BSD
                  profiling support.  Same as -qprofile=pg.
        -P        Preprocess but do not compile; output goes to .i file.
        -Q<x>, -qinline<x>
                  Inline all appropriate functions where x can be
                  one of the following:
                    !       Not inline any function (equivalent to -qnoinline)
                    =<lc>   Inline if number of source statement in
                            function is less than the number specified
                            in <lc>.
                    -<nm>   Not inline function listed by names in <nm>
                    +<nm>   Attempt to inline function listed by names
                            in <nm>.
        -r        Produce the output file without linking any library.
        -S        Produce a .s file for any source file processed by the
                  compiler.
        -t<x>     Apply prefix from the -B option to the specified program <x>,
                  where x can be one or more of the following:
                    a = assembler
                    b = compiler backend
                    c = compiler frontend
                    i = compiler inliner
                    I = inter-procedural analysis - compile phase
                    l = linkage editor
                    L = inter-procedural analysis - link phase.
                    p = preprocessor
        -U<name>  Undefine name as in #undef directive.
        -v        Displays language processing commands as they
                  are invoked by xlc; output goes to stdout.
        -V        Displays commands as they are invoked by xlC;
                  output goes to stdout.
        -w        Suppress informational, language-level, and
                  warning messages.
        -W<x,y>   Give the options <y> to the compiler program <x>
                  where x can be one or more of the following:
                    <a,b,c,f,I,l,L,p>
        -y<x>     Specify compile-time rounding of constant floating-point
                  expressions, where <x> can be one of the following:
                    m = round toward minus infinity
                    n = round to nearest
                    p = round toward positive infinity
                    z = round toward zero.

       2. Keyword options:

          Keyword options are specified in one of the following ways:

          -q<option>
          -q<option>=<parameter>
          -q<option>=<parameter>:<parameter>

          where <option> is an option name and <parameter> is a
          parameter value.
          Keyword options with no parameters represent switches
          that may be either on or off. The keyword by itself turns
          the switch on, and the keyword preceded by the letters NO
          turns the switch off. For example, -qLIST tells the
          compiler to produce a listing and -qNOLIST tells the
          compiler not to produce a listing. If an option that
          represents a switch is set more than once, the compiler
          uses the last setting.

          Keyword option and parameter names may appear in either
          UPPER CASE or lower case letters in the xlc command.


          Options without parameters:

          32          Selects 32-bit compiler mode.
          64          Selects 64-bit compiler mode.
          ansialias   Use type-based aliasing during optimization.
          compact     Reduce code size where possible, at the expense
                      of execution speed.  Code size is reduced by
                      inhibiting optimizations that replicate or expand
                      code inline.
          cpluscmt    Permit "//" to introduce a comment that lasts
                      until the end of the current source line, as in C++.
          dbcs        String literals and comments can contain DBCS
                      characters (same as mbcs option).
          dbxextra    Generate symbol table information for unreferenced
                      variables. By default such information is not generated
                      thus reducing the size of the executable compiled with
                      the "-g" option.  Same as -qsymtab=unref.
          digraph     Allow special digraph
          dollar      Allow '$' as an identifier character
          dpcl        Generates symbols for tools based on the Dynamic

                      with their declarations even if the procedure has
                      not been prototyped. This allows the caller to
                      pass floating point arguments in floating point
                      registers instead of general purpose registers.
          report      Adds information to the listing file on the loop

                      1, 2, 4 or 8.
                      small denotes that either one, two, four or eight (valid
                      in 64-bit mode only) bytes of storage will be allocated
                      for enum variables based on the range of the enum
                      constants.
                      int is the default, and causes enum variables to be
                      treated as though they were of type signed int
                      depending on the range of the enum constants.
                      1 will cause enum variables to be packed into 1 byte.

                      Specify which functions are imported.  If no filenames
                      are specified, all invoked functions are assumed to be
                      defined outside the current file.  The last explicit
                      specification for a function takes precedence.
          proclocal=<name1>:<name2>: ...
                      Specify which functions are local.
                      If no filenames are specified, all invoked functions

                      Specify which functions are unknown to be local or
                      imported.  If no filenames are specified, all functions
                      called are assumed to be unknown. This is the default
                      when no user options are specified. The last explicit
                      specification for a function takes precedence.
          profile=<option>
                      Sets up the object files produced by the compiler for

                      automatic parallelization.  The auto and omp suboptions
                      are opposites. i.e. -qsmp=omp means strict adherance
                      to the OpenMP standard with no automatic parallelization.
                      [no]auto

  Description:
     The xlC and related commands compile C and C++ source files.
     They also processes assembler source files and object files. Unless the
     -c option is specified, xlC calls the linkage editor to produce a
     single object file. Input files may be any of the following:
       1. file name with .c suffix: C source file
       2. file name with .i suffix: preprocessed C or C++ source file
       3. file name with .o suffix: object file for ld command
       4. file name with .s suffix: assembler source file
       5. file name with .so suffix: shared object file

  Options:
     Options can be flag options or keyword options:

       1. Flag options:

        -#        Display language processing commands but do
                  not invoke them; output goes to stdout.
        -bdynamic, -bstatic
                  Determines which types of library files are searched by
                  the linkage editor.
        -brtl     Tells the linkage editor to accept both .so and .a
                  library file types.
        -B<prefix>
                  Construct alternate compiler/assembler/linkage editor
                  program names. <prefix> is added to the beginning of
                  the standard program names.
        -c        Do not send object files to the linkage editor.
        -C        Write comments to output when doing preprocessing,
                  used with -E and -P.
        -D<name>[=<def>]
                  Define <name> as in #define directive. If <def> is
                  not specified, 1 is assumed.
        -E        Preprocess but do not compile; output goes to stdout
        -f<filename>
                  Passes to the linkage editor the filename of a file
                  containing a list of input files to be processed.
        -F<x>[:<stanza>]
                  Use alternate configuration file <x> with optional
                  <stanza>. If <stanza> is not specified, the assumed stanza
                  is the name of the command used to invoke the compiler.
        -g        Produce information for the debugger.
        -G        Tells the linkage editor to create a dynamic library.
        -I<dir>   Search in directory <dir> for include files that

        -l<key>   Search the specified library file,
                  where <key> selects the file lib<key>.a.
        -L<dir>   Search in directory <dir> for files specified by -l<key>.
        -ma       Generate inline calls to the "alloca" function as if
                  "#pragma alloca" directives were in the source file.
        -M        Generate information to be included in a "make"
                  description file; output goes to .u file.
        -o<name>  Name the executable file <name> instead of a.out.
                  When used with the -c option and one source file,
                  name the object file <name> instead of filename.o.
                  If <name> is the name of a directory, files generated by
                  the compiler will be placed into that directory.
        -O        Optimize generated code.
        -O2       Same as -O.
        -O3       Perform some memory and compile time intensive
                  optimizations in addition to those executed with -O2.
                  The -O3 specific optimizations have the potential to
                  alter the semantics of a user's program.
                  The compiler guards against these optimizations at -O2
                  and the option -qstrict is provided at -O3 to turn off
                  these aggressive optimizations.

                  architecture and tuning option ideal for that platform.
        -O5       Equivalent to -O3 -qipa=level=2 with automatic
                  generation of architecture and tuning option ideal for
                  that platform.

                    =<lc>   Inline if number of source statement in
                            function is less than the number specified
                            in <lc>.

        -r        Produce the output file without linking any library.
        -S        Produce a .s file for any source file processed by the
                  compiler.
        -t<x>     Apply prefix from the -B option to the specified program <x>,
                  where x can be one or more of the following:
                    a = assembler
                    b = compiler backend
                    c = compiler frontend
                    i = compiler inliner
                    I = inter-procedural analysis - compile phase
                    l = linkage editor
                    L = inter-procedural analysis - link phase.
                    p = preprocessor
        -U<name>  Undefine name as in #undef directive.
        -v        Displays language processing commands as they
                  are invoked by xlc; output goes to stdout.
        -V        Displays commands as they are invoked by xlC;
                  output goes to stdout.
        -w        Suppress informational, language-level, and
                  warning messages.
        -W<x,y>   Give the options <y> to the compiler program <x>
                  where x can be one or more of the following:
                    <a,b,c,f,I,l,L,p>
        -y<x>     Specify compile-time rounding of constant floating-point
                  expressions, where <x> can be one of the following:
                    m = round toward minus infinity
                    n = round to nearest
                    p = round toward positive infinity
                    z = round toward zero.

       2. Keyword options:

          Keyword options are specified in one of the following ways:

          -q<option>
          -q<option>=<parameter>
          -q<option>=<parameter>:<parameter>

          where <option> is an option name and <parameter> is a
          parameter value.
          Keyword options with no parameters represent switches
          that may be either on or off. The keyword by itself turns
          the switch on, and the keyword preceded by the letters NO
          turns the switch off. For example, -qLIST tells the
          compiler to produce a listing and -qNOLIST tells the
          compiler not to produce a listing. If an option that
          represents a switch is set more than once, the compiler
          uses the last setting.

          Keyword option and parameter names may appear in either
          UPPER CASE or lower case letters in the xlc command.


          Options without parameters:

          32          Selects 32-bit compiler mode.

          compact     Reduce code size where possible, at the expense
                      of execution speed.  Code size is reduced by
                      inhibiting optimizations that replicate or expand
                      code inline.
          cpluscmt    Permit "//" to introduce a comment that lasts
                      until the end of the current source line, as in C++.

                      characters (same as mbcs option).
          dbxextra    Generate symbol table information for unreferenced
                      variables. By default such information is not generated
                      thus reducing the size of the executable compiled with
                      the "-g" option.  Same as -qsymtab=unref.

          idirfirst   Specify the search order for files included with
                      the #include "file_name" directive.  Use -qidirfirst
                      with the -Idirectory option.  If -qidirfirst option
                      is specified, the directories specified by the
                      -Idirectory option are searched before the directory
                      where the current file resides.
          ignerrno    Tell the optimizer that the program will never
                      refer to or set errno.  This allows additional
                      optimizations.
          inlglue     Generate fast external linkage by inlining the
                      code (pointer glue code) necessary at calls

                      If -qnostdinc is specified, the /usr/include directory
                      is not searched.
          optimize    Same as O and O2. Perform optimization that is the
                      mix between speed and size.  (If -qnooptimize is
                      specified, it is equivalent to -qoptimize=0.)
          pascal      Accept and ignore the keyword 'pascal' as a
                      type modifier.
          pdf1, pdf2  Perform aggressive optimizations with profile

          proto       Assert that procedure call points agree
                      with their declarations even if the procedure has
                      not been prototyped. This allows the caller to
                      pass floating point arguments in floating point
                      registers instead of general purpose registers.
          report      Adds information to the listing file on the loop
                      transformations that have been carried out.

                      uninitialized static variables, to the name list
                      (the symbol table of xcoff objects).  Same as
                      -qsymtab=static.
          strict      Turns off aggressive optimizations which have the
                      potential to alter the semantics of a user's program.

                      Turns off induction variable optimizations
                      that have the potential to alter the semantics of a

                      -O2 or higher and "strict_induction" otherwise.
                      "nostrict_induction" is recomended if your program does
                      not have overflows or wrap arounds of loop induction
                      variables.

                      1, 2, 4 or 8.
                      small denotes that either one, two, four or eight (valid
                      in 64-bit mode only) bytes of storage will be allocated
                      for enum variables based on the range of the enum
                      constants.
                      int is the default, and causes enum variables to be
                      treated as though they were of type signed int
                      depending on the range of the enum constants.
                      1 will cause enum variables to be packed into 1 byte.

                      Specify which functions are local.
                      If no filenames are specified, all invoked functions

                      called are assumed to be unknown. This is the default
                      when no user options are specified. The last explicit
                      specification for a function takes precedence.

                      place it in the text segment at the end of the
                      function code.
                      The available options are:
                      none    No traceback table is generated.
                      full    A full traceback table is generated.
                              This is the default with -g specified.
                      small   A traceback table is generated with no name or
                              parameter information.
                              This is the default when -g is NOT specified.
          tune=<option>

                      no      Force the compiler not to unroll any loops.
                      auto    Let the compiler decide whether to unroll loops.
          unroll      same as unroll=yes
          nounroll    same as unroll=no
          xref=full   Produce a cross-reference listing containing all names,
                      whether referenced or not; output goes to .lst file.

  Description:
     The xlC and related commands compile C and C++ source files.
     They also processes assembler source files and object files. Unless the
     -c option is specified, xlC calls the linkage editor to produce a
     single object file. Input files may be any of the following:
       1. file name with .c suffix: C source file
       2. file name with .i suffix: preprocessed C or C++ source file
       3. file name with .o suffix: object file for ld command
       4. file name with .s suffix: assembler source file
       5. file name with .so suffix: shared object file

  Options:
     Options can be flag options or keyword options:

       1. Flag options:

        -#        Display language processing commands but do
                  not invoke them; output goes to stdout.
        -bdynamic, -bstatic
                  Determines which types of library files are searched by
                  the linkage editor.
        -brtl     Tells the linkage editor to accept both .so and .a
                  library file types.
        -B<prefix>
                  Construct alternate compiler/assembler/linkage editor
                  program names. <prefix> is added to the beginning of
                  the standard program names.
        -c        Do not send object files to the linkage editor.
        -C        Write comments to output when doing preprocessing,
                  used with -E and -P.
        -D<name>[=<def>]
                  Define <name> as in #define directive. If <def> is
                  not specified, 1 is assumed.
        -E        Preprocess but do not compile; output goes to stdout
        -f<filename>
                  Passes to the linkage editor the filename of a file
                  containing a list of input files to be processed.
        -F<x>[:<stanza>]
                  Use alternate configuration file <x> with optional
                  <stanza>. If <stanza> is not specified, the assumed stanza
                  is the name of the command used to invoke the compiler.
        -g        Produce information for the debugger.
        -G        Tells the linkage editor to create a dynamic library.
        -I<dir>   Search in directory <dir> for include files that
                  do not start with an absolute path.
        -l<key>   Search the specified library file,
                  where <key> selects the file lib<key>.a.
        -L<dir>   Search in directory <dir> for files specified by -l<key>.
        -ma       Generate inline calls to the "alloca" function as if
                  "#pragma alloca" directives were in the source file.
        -M        Generate information to be included in a "make"
                  description file; output goes to .u file.
        -o<name>  Name the executable file <name> instead of a.out.
                  When used with the -c option and one source file,
                  name the object file <name> instead of filename.o.
                  If <name> is the name of a directory, files generated by
                  the compiler will be placed into that directory.
        -O        Optimize generated code.
        -O2       Same as -O.
        -O3       Perform some memory and compile time intensive
                  optimizations in addition to those executed with -O2.
                  The -O3 specific optimizations have the potential to
                  alter the semantics of a user's program.
                  The compiler guards against these optimizations at -O2
                  and the option -qstrict is provided at -O3 to turn off
                  these aggressive optimizations.
        -O4       Equivalent to -O3 -qipa with automatic generation of
                  architecture and tuning option ideal for that platform.
        -O5       Equivalent to -O3 -qipa=level=2 with automatic
                  generation of architecture and tuning option ideal for
                  that platform.
        -p        Generate profiling support code.  Same as -qprofile=p.
        -pg       Generate profiling support code including BSD
                  profiling support.  Same as -qprofile=pg.
        -P        Preprocess but do not compile; output goes to .i file.
        -Q<x>, -qinline<x>
                  Inline all appropriate functions where x can be
                  one of the following:
                    !       Not inline any function (equivalent to -qnoinline)
                    =<lc>   Inline if number of source statement in
                            function is less than the number specified
                            in <lc>.
                    -<nm>   Not inline function listed by names in <nm>
                    +<nm>   Attempt to inline function listed by names
                            in <nm>.
        -r        Produce the output file without linking any library.
        -S        Produce a .s file for any source file processed by the
                  compiler.
        -t<x>     Apply prefix from the -B option to the specified program <x>,
                  where x can be one or more of the following:
                    a = assembler
                    b = compiler backend
                    c = compiler frontend
                    i = compiler inliner
                    I = inter-procedural analysis - compile phase
                    l = linkage editor
                    L = inter-procedural analysis - link phase.
                    p = preprocessor
        -U<name>  Undefine name as in #undef directive.
        -v        Displays language processing commands as they
                  are invoked by xlc; output goes to stdout.
        -V        Displays commands as they are invoked by xlC;
                  output goes to stdout.
        -w        Suppress informational, language-level, and
                  warning messages.
        -W<x,y>   Give the options <y> to the compiler program <x>
                  where x can be one or more of the following:
                    <a,b,c,f,I,l,L,p>
        -y<x>     Specify compile-time rounding of constant floating-point
                  expressions, where <x> can be one of the following:
                    m = round toward minus infinity
                    n = round to nearest
                    p = round toward positive infinity
                    z = round toward zero.

       2. Keyword options:

          Keyword options are specified in one of the following ways:

          -q<option>
          -q<option>=<parameter>
          -q<option>=<parameter>:<parameter>

          where <option> is an option name and <parameter> is a
          parameter value.
          Keyword options with no parameters represent switches
          that may be either on or off. The keyword by itself turns
          the switch on, and the keyword preceded by the letters NO
          turns the switch off. For example, -qLIST tells the
          compiler to produce a listing and -qNOLIST tells the
          compiler not to produce a listing. If an option that
          represents a switch is set more than once, the compiler
          uses the last setting.

          Keyword option and parameter names may appear in either
          UPPER CASE or lower case letters in the xlc command.


          Options without parameters:

                      inhibiting optimizations that replicate or expand
                      code inline.
          cpluscmt    Permit "//" to introduce a comment that lasts
                      until the end of the current source line, as in C++.

                      with the -Idirectory option.  If -qidirfirst option
                      is specified, the directories specified by the
                      -Idirectory option are searched before the directory
                      where the current file resides.
          ignerrno    Tell the optimizer that the program will never
                      refer to or set errno.  This allows additional

                      If -qnostdinc is specified, the /usr/include directory
                      is not searched.
          optimize    Same as O and O2. Perform optimization that is the
                      mix between speed and size.  (If -qnooptimize is

          proto       Assert that procedure call points agree
                      with their declarations even if the procedure has
                      not been prototyped. This allows the caller to
                      pass floating point arguments in floating point
                      registers instead of general purpose registers.
          report      Adds information to the listing file on the loop
                      transformations that have been carried out.

                      uninitialized static variables, to the name list
                      (the symbol table of xcoff objects).  Same as
                      -qsymtab=static.
          strict      Turns off aggressive optimizations which have the
                      potential to alter the semantics of a user's program.

                      in 64-bit mode only) bytes of storage will be allocated
                      for enum variables based on the range of the enum
                      constants.
                      int is the default, and causes enum variables to be
                      treated as though they were of type signed int

                      Specify which functions are imported.  If no filenames
                      are specified, all invoked functions are assumed to be
                      defined outside the current file.  The last explicit
                      specification for a function takes precedence.
          proclocal=<name1>:<name2>: ...
                      Specify which functions are local.
                      If no filenames are specified, all invoked functions

                      imported.  If no filenames are specified, all functions
                      called are assumed to be unknown. This is the default
                      when no user options are specified. The last explicit
                      specification for a function takes precedence.

                      are opposites. i.e. -qsmp=omp means strict adherance
                      to the OpenMP standard with no automatic parallelization.
                      [no]auto

  Description:
     The xlC and related commands compile C and C++ source files.
     They also processes assembler source files and object files. Unless the
     -c option is specified, xlC calls the linkage editor to produce a
     single object file. Input files may be any of the following:
       1. file name with .c suffix: C source file
       2. file name with .i suffix: preprocessed C or C++ source file
       3. file name with .o suffix: object file for ld command
       4. file name with .s suffix: assembler source file
       5. file name with .so suffix: shared object file

  Options:
     Options can be flag options or keyword options:

       1. Flag options:

        -#        Display language processing commands but do
                  not invoke them; output goes to stdout.
        -bdynamic, -bstatic
                  Determines which types of library files are searched by
                  the linkage editor.
        -brtl     Tells the linkage editor to accept both .so and .a
                  library file types.
        -B<prefix>
                  Construct alternate compiler/assembler/linkage editor
                  program names. <prefix> is added to the beginning of
                  the standard program names.
        -c        Do not send object files to the linkage editor.
        -C        Write comments to output when doing preprocessing,
                  used with -E and -P.
        -D<name>[=<def>]
                  Define <name> as in #define directive. If <def> is
                  not specified, 1 is assumed.
        -E        Preprocess but do not compile; output goes to stdout
        -f<filename>
                  Passes to the linkage editor the filename of a file
                  containing a list of input files to be processed.
        -F<x>[:<stanza>]
                  Use alternate configuration file <x> with optional
                  <stanza>. If <stanza> is not specified, the assumed stanza
                  is the name of the command used to invoke the compiler.
        -g        Produce information for the debugger.
        -G        Tells the linkage editor to create a dynamic library.
        -I<dir>   Search in directory <dir> for include files that
                  do not start with an absolute path.
        -l<key>   Search the specified library file,
                  where <key> selects the file lib<key>.a.
        -L<dir>   Search in directory <dir> for files specified by -l<key>.
        -ma       Generate inline calls to the "alloca" function as if
                  "#pragma alloca" directives were in the source file.
        -M        Generate information to be included in a "make"
                  description file; output goes to .u file.
        -o<name>  Name the executable file <name> instead of a.out.
                  When used with the -c option and one source file,
                  name the object file <name> instead of filename.o.
                  If <name> is the name of a directory, files generated by
                  the compiler will be placed into that directory.
        -O        Optimize generated code.
        -O2       Same as -O.
        -O3       Perform some memory and compile time intensive
                  optimizations in addition to those executed with -O2.
                  The -O3 specific optimizations have the potential to
                  alter the semantics of a user's program.
                  The compiler guards against these optimizations at -O2
                  and the option -qstrict is provided at -O3 to turn off
                  these aggressive optimizations.
        -O4       Equivalent to -O3 -qipa with automatic generation of
                  architecture and tuning option ideal for that platform.
        -O5       Equivalent to -O3 -qipa=level=2 with automatic
                  generation of architecture and tuning option ideal for
                  that platform.
        -p        Generate profiling support code.  Same as -qprofile=p.
        -pg       Generate profiling support code including BSD
                  profiling support.  Same as -qprofile=pg.
        -P        Preprocess but do not compile; output goes to .i file.
        -Q<x>, -qinline<x>
                  Inline all appropriate functions where x can be
                  one of the following:
                    !       Not inline any function (equivalent to -qnoinline)
                    =<lc>   Inline if number of source statement in
                            function is less than the number specified
                            in <lc>.
                    -<nm>   Not inline function listed by names in <nm>
                    +<nm>   Attempt to inline function listed by names
                            in <nm>.
        -r        Produce the output file without linking any library.
        -S        Produce a .s file for any source file processed by the
                  compiler.
        -t<x>     Apply prefix from the -B option to the specified program <x>,
                  where x can be one or more of the following:
                    a = assembler
                    b = compiler backend
                    c = compiler frontend
                    i = compiler inliner
                    I = inter-procedural analysis - compile phase
                    l = linkage editor
                    L = inter-procedural analysis - link phase.
                    p = preprocessor
        -U<name>  Undefine name as in #undef directive.
        -v        Displays language processing commands as they
                  are invoked by xlc; output goes to stdout.
        -V        Displays commands as they are invoked by xlC;
                  output goes to stdout.
        -w        Suppress informational, language-level, and
                  warning messages.
        -W<x,y>   Give the options <y> to the compiler program <x>
                  where x can be one or more of the following:
                    <a,b,c,f,I,l,L,p>
        -y<x>     Specify compile-time rounding of constant floating-point
                  expressions, where <x> can be one of the following:
                    m = round toward minus infinity
                    n = round to nearest
                    p = round toward positive infinity
                    z = round toward zero.

       2. Keyword options:

          Keyword options are specified in one of the following ways:

          -q<option>
          -q<option>=<parameter>
          -q<option>=<parameter>:<parameter>

          where <option> is an option name and <parameter> is a
          parameter value.
          Keyword options with no parameters represent switches
          that may be either on or off. The keyword by itself turns
          the switch on, and the keyword preceded by the letters NO
          turns the switch off. For example, -qLIST tells the
          compiler to produce a listing and -qNOLIST tells the
          compiler not to produce a listing. If an option that
          represents a switch is set more than once, the compiler
          uses the last setting.

          Keyword option and parameter names may appear in either
          UPPER CASE or lower case letters in the xlc command.


          Options without parameters:

          32          Selects 32-bit compiler mode.
          64          Selects 64-bit compiler mode.
          ansialias   Use type-based aliasing during optimization.
          compact     Reduce code size where possible, at the expense
                      of execution speed.  Code size is reduced by
                      inhibiting optimizations that replicate or expand
                      code inline.
          cpluscmt    Permit "//" to introduce a comment that lasts
                      until the end of the current source line, as in C++.
          dbcs        String literals and comments can contain DBCS
                      characters (same as mbcs option).
          dbxextra    Generate symbol table information for unreferenced
                      variables. By default such information is not generated
                      thus reducing the size of the executable compiled with
                      the "-g" option.  Same as -qsymtab=unref.
          digraph     Allow special digraph
          dollar      Allow '$' as an identifier character
          dpcl        Generates symbols for tools based on the Dynamic

                      performance-tuning utility.
          flttrap     Generate instructions to trap floating-point
                      exceptions.
          fold        Specifies that constant floating-point expressions

          funcsect    Place instructions for each function in a separate csect.
          heapdebug   Enables debug versions of memory management functions.
          hot         Determines whether or not to perform high-order
                      transformations on loops during optimization.
          idirfirst   Specify the search order for files included with
                      the #include "file_name" directive.  Use -qidirfirst
                      with the -Idirectory option.  If -qidirfirst option
                      is specified, the directories specified by the
                      -Idirectory option are searched before the directory
                      where the current file resides.
          ignerrno    Tell the optimizer that the program will never
                      refer to or set errno.  This allows additional
                      optimizations.
          inlglue     Generate fast external linkage by inlining the
                      code (pointer glue code) necessary at calls
                      via a function pointer and calls to external
                      procedures.
          largepage   Take advantage of 16M pages, which will allow for
                      reduced TLB entries and allow hardware prefetching

          longlit     Changes implicit type selection for integer constants in
                      64-bit mode.
          longlong    Allow long long integers.
          macpstr     Allow '\p' as the first character of a string constant
                      which will be replaced by the length in bytes.
          makedep     Creates an output file that contains targets suitable for
                      inclusion in a description file for the AIX make command.
          mbcs        String literals and comments can contain DBCS
                      characters (same as dbcs option).
          mkshrobj    Create a shared object from generated object files.
          noprint     Direct listing to /dev/null.
          nostdinc    Specify which files are included with the #include
                      "file_name" and #include <file_name> directives.
                      If -qnostdinc is specified, the /usr/include directory
                      is not searched.
          optimize    Same as O and O2. Perform optimization that is the
                      mix between speed and size.  (If -qnooptimize is
                      specified, it is equivalent to -qoptimize=0.)
          pascal      Accept and ignore the keyword 'pascal' as a
                      type modifier.
          pdf1, pdf2  Perform aggressive optimizations with profile
                      directed feedback.
          phsinfo     Produce compiler phase information; output goes to
                      stdout.
          proto       Assert that procedure call points agree
                      with their declarations even if the procedure has
                      not been prototyped. This allows the caller to
                      pass floating point arguments in floating point
                      registers instead of general purpose registers.
          report      Adds information to the listing file on the loop
                      transformations that have been carried out.
                      This option requires either -qhot or -qsmp
                      in order to have effect.
          ro          Put string literals in read only area.
          roconst     Put constant values in read only area.

                      of a limited stack size.
          source      Produce a source listing; output goes to .lst file.
          srcmsg      Reconstruct source lines in error along with the
                      diagnostic messages in the stderr file.
          statsym     Adds user-defined, nonexternal names that have a
                      persistent storage class, such as initialized and
                      uninitialized static variables, to the name list
                      (the symbol table of xcoff objects).  Same as
                      -qsymtab=static.
          strict      Turns off aggressive optimizations which have the
                      potential to alter the semantics of a user's program.
                      This option also sets -qfloat=nofltint:norsqrt.
          strict_induction
                      Turns off induction variable optimizations
                      that have the potential to alter the semantics of a
                      user's program. The default is "nostrict_induction" at
                      -O2 or higher and "strict_induction" otherwise.
                      "nostrict_induction" is recomended if your program does
                      not have overflows or wrap arounds of loop induction
                      variables.
          syntaxonly  Causes the compiler to perform syntax checking without

                      option and merge the address information to access
                      ranges of external addresses using a single Table Of
                      Content entry.

                      tailoring reduces the number of saves and restores
                      of non-volatile registers, but is enabled only when
                      stack unwinding is disabled.
          xcall       Generate code to static routines within a compilation
                      unit as if they were external routines.
          xref        Produce a cross-reference listing containing
                      only referenced names.



          Options with parameters:
          aggrcopy=[no]overlap
                      Asserts whether source and destination of aggregate
                      assignments overlap.
          alias=<option>
                      Specifies the aliasing assertion to be applied to
                      your compilation unit.
                      The available options are:
                      addr    Variables are disjoint from pointers
                              unless their address is taken.
                      allp    Pointers are never aliased.
                      ansi    Pointers can only point to an object of the
                              same type. Require -O option.
                      typ     Pointers to different types are never aliased.

                      bit_packed
                              Similar to packed, except bit-fields are
                              packed as tightly as possible.
                      full    The compiler uses the RISC System/6000
                              alignment rules. This is the same as power.
                      mac68k  The compiler uses the Macintosh**
                              alignment rules.

                      Specify whether minimum-sized enumerated types will be
                      produced or not. <enumopt> can be either small, int,
                      1, 2, 4 or 8.
                      small denotes that either one, two, four or eight (valid
                      in 64-bit mode only) bytes of storage will be allocated
                      for enum variables based on the range of the enum
                      constants.
                      int is the default, and causes enum variables to be
                      treated as though they were of type signed int
                      depending on the range of the enum constants.
                      1 will cause enum variables to be packed into 1 byte.
                      2 will cause enum variables to be packed into 2 bytes.
                      4 will cause enum variables to be packed into 4 bytes.
                      8 will cause enum variables to be packed into 8 bytes.
                        (enum=8 is valid in 64-bit mode only)

                      hexadecimal value.  This generates extra code and
                      should only be used for error determination.
          inline[=<x>]
                      This is functionally equivalent to the -Q option.

                                     that are analyzed together.  Larger
                                     partitions may produce better analysis but
                                     require more storage.

                                     dummy arguments and call other parts of
                                     the program compiled with -qipa.
                        The following options are intended for use by the
                        link-time phase of -qipa:

          procimported=<name1>:<name2>: ...
                      Specify which functions are imported.  If no filenames
                      are specified, all invoked functions are assumed to be
                      defined outside the current file.  The last explicit
                      specification for a function takes precedence.
          proclocal=<name1>:<name2>: ...
                      Specify which functions are local.
                      If no filenames are specified, all invoked functions
                      are assumed to be defined within the current file.
                      The last explicit specification for a function takes

                      Specify which functions are unknown to be local or
                      imported.  If no filenames are specified, all functions
                      called are assumed to be unknown. This is the default
                      when no user options are specified. The last explicit
                      specification for a function takes precedence.
          profile=<option>
                      Sets up the object files produced by the compiler for
                      profiling.

                      automatic parallelization.  The auto and omp suboptions
                      are opposites. i.e. -qsmp=omp means strict adherance
                      to the OpenMP standard with no automatic parallelization.
                      [no]auto
                              Enables or disables automatic parallelization.

                              assigned in the source code.
                              Valid options for <sched_type> are:
                                         * dynamic[=n]
                                         * guided[=n]

  Description:
     The xlC and related commands compile C and C++ source files.
     They also processes assembler source files and object files. Unless the
     -c option is specified, xlC calls the linkage editor to produce a
     single object file. Input files may be any of the following:
       1. file name with .c suffix: C source file
       2. file name with .i suffix: preprocessed C or C++ source file
       3. file name with .o suffix: object file for ld command
       4. file name with .s suffix: assembler source file
       5. file name with .so suffix: shared object file

  Options:
     Options can be flag options or keyword options:

       1. Flag options:

        -#        Display language processing commands but do
                  not invoke them; output goes to stdout.
        -bdynamic, -bstatic
                  Determines which types of library files are searched by
                  the linkage editor.
        -brtl     Tells the linkage editor to accept both .so and .a
                  library file types.
        -B<prefix>
                  Construct alternate compiler/assembler/linkage editor
                  program names. <prefix> is added to the beginning of
                  the standard program names.
        -c        Do not send object files to the linkage editor.
        -C        Write comments to output when doing preprocessing,
                  used with -E and -P.
        -D<name>[=<def>]
                  Define <name> as in #define directive. If <def> is
                  not specified, 1 is assumed.
        -E        Preprocess but do not compile; output goes to stdout
        -f<filename>
                  Passes to the linkage editor the filename of a file
                  containing a list of input files to be processed.
        -F<x>[:<stanza>]
                  Use alternate configuration file <x> with optional
                  <stanza>. If <stanza> is not specified, the assumed stanza
                  is the name of the command used to invoke the compiler.
        -g        Produce information for the debugger.
        -G        Tells the linkage editor to create a dynamic library.
        -I<dir>   Search in directory <dir> for include files that
                  do not start with an absolute path.
        -l<key>   Search the specified library file,
                  where <key> selects the file lib<key>.a.
        -L<dir>   Search in directory <dir> for files specified by -l<key>.
        -ma       Generate inline calls to the "alloca" function as if
                  "#pragma alloca" directives were in the source file.
        -M        Generate information to be included in a "make"
                  description file; output goes to .u file.
        -o<name>  Name the executable file <name> instead of a.out.
                  When used with the -c option and one source file,
                  name the object file <name> instead of filename.o.
                  If <name> is the name of a directory, files generated by
                  the compiler will be placed into that directory.
        -O        Optimize generated code.
        -O2       Same as -O.
        -O3       Perform some memory and compile time intensive
                  optimizations in addition to those executed with -O2.
                  The -O3 specific optimizations have the potential to
                  alter the semantics of a user's program.
                  The compiler guards against these optimizations at -O2
                  and the option -qstrict is provided at -O3 to turn off
                  these aggressive optimizations.
        -O4       Equivalent to -O3 -qipa with automatic generation of
                  architecture and tuning option ideal for that platform.
        -O5       Equivalent to -O3 -qipa=level=2 with automatic
                  generation of architecture and tuning option ideal for
                  that platform.
        -p        Generate profiling support code.  Same as -qprofile=p.
        -pg       Generate profiling support code including BSD
                  profiling support.  Same as -qprofile=pg.
        -P        Preprocess but do not compile; output goes to .i file.
        -Q<x>, -qinline<x>
                  Inline all appropriate functions where x can be
                  one of the following:
                    !       Not inline any function (equivalent to -qnoinline)
                    =<lc>   Inline if number of source statement in
                            function is less than the number specified
                            in <lc>.
                    -<nm>   Not inline function listed by names in <nm>
                    +<nm>   Attempt to inline function listed by names
                            in <nm>.
        -r        Produce the output file without linking any library.
        -S        Produce a .s file for any source file processed by the
                  compiler.
        -t<x>     Apply prefix from the -B option to the specified program <x>,
                  where x can be one or more of the following:
                    a = assembler
                    b = compiler backend
                    c = compiler frontend
                    i = compiler inliner
                    I = inter-procedural analysis - compile phase
                    l = linkage editor
                    L = inter-procedural analysis - link phase.
                    p = preprocessor
        -U<name>  Undefine name as in #undef directive.
        -v        Displays language processing commands as they
                  are invoked by xlc; output goes to stdout.
        -V        Displays commands as they are invoked by xlC;
                  output goes to stdout.
        -w        Suppress informational, language-level, and
                  warning messages.
        -W<x,y>   Give the options <y> to the compiler program <x>
                  where x can be one or more of the following:
                    <a,b,c,f,I,l,L,p>
        -y<x>     Specify compile-time rounding of constant floating-point
                  expressions, where <x> can be one of the following:
                    m = round toward minus infinity
                    n = round to nearest
                    p = round toward positive infinity
                    z = round toward zero.

       2. Keyword options:

          Keyword options are specified in one of the following ways:

          -q<option>
          -q<option>=<parameter>
          -q<option>=<parameter>:<parameter>

          where <option> is an option name and <parameter> is a
          parameter value.
          Keyword options with no parameters represent switches
          that may be either on or off. The keyword by itself turns
          the switch on, and the keyword preceded by the letters NO
          turns the switch off. For example, -qLIST tells the
          compiler to produce a listing and -qNOLIST tells the
          compiler not to produce a listing. If an option that
          represents a switch is set more than once, the compiler
          uses the last setting.

          Keyword option and parameter names may appear in either
          UPPER CASE or lower case letters in the xlc command.


          Options without parameters:

          32          Selects 32-bit compiler mode.
          64          Selects 64-bit compiler mode.
          ansialias   Use type-based aliasing during optimization.
          compact     Reduce code size where possible, at the expense
                      of execution speed.  Code size is reduced by
                      inhibiting optimizations that replicate or expand
                      code inline.
          cpluscmt    Permit "//" to introduce a comment that lasts
                      until the end of the current source line, as in C++.
          dbcs        String literals and comments can contain DBCS
                      characters (same as mbcs option).
          dbxextra    Generate symbol table information for unreferenced
                      variables. By default such information is not generated
                      thus reducing the size of the executable compiled with
                      the "-g" option.  Same as -qsymtab=unref.
          digraph     Allow special digraph
          dollar      Allow '$' as an identifier character
          dpcl        Generates symbols for tools based on the Dynamic
                      Probe Class Library (DPCL)
          extchk      Perform external name type-checking and function
                      call checking.
          fdpr        Collect information about programs for use with
                      the AIX fdpr (Feedback Directed Program Restructuring)
                      performance-tuning utility.
          flttrap     Generate instructions to trap floating-point
                      exceptions.
          fold        Specifies that constant floating-point expressions
                      are to be evaluated at compile time.
          fullpath    Specifies the path information stored for files when
                      you use "-g" and the symbolic debugger.
          funcsect    Place instructions for each function in a separate csect.
          heapdebug   Enables debug versions of memory management functions.
          hot         Determines whether or not to perform high-order
                      transformations on loops during optimization.
          idirfirst   Specify the search order for files included with
                      the #include "file_name" directive.  Use -qidirfirst
                      with the -Idirectory option.  If -qidirfirst option
                      is specified, the directories specified by the
                      -Idirectory option are searched before the directory
                      where the current file resides.
          ignerrno    Tell the optimizer that the program will never
                      refer to or set errno.  This allows additional
                      optimizations.
          inlglue     Generate fast external linkage by inlining the
                      code (pointer glue code) necessary at calls
                      via a function pointer and calls to external
                      procedures.
          largepage   Take advantage of 16M pages, which will allow for

                      1, 2, 4 or 8.
                      small denotes that either one, two, four or eight (valid
                      in 64-bit mode only) bytes of storage will be allocated
                      for enum variables based on the range of the enum
                      constants.
                      int is the default, and causes enum variables to be
                      treated as though they were of type signed int
                      depending on the range of the enum constants.
                      1 will cause enum variables to be packed into 1 byte.

          flag=<sev1>:<sev2>
                      Specify severity level of diagnostics to be reported
                      in source listing (<sev1>), and stderr (<sev2>);

          procimported=<name1>:<name2>: ...
                      Specify which functions are imported.  If no filenames
                      are specified, all invoked functions are assumed to be
                      defined outside the current file.  The last explicit
                      specification for a function takes precedence.
          proclocal=<name1>:<name2>: ...
                      Specify which functions are local.
                      If no filenames are specified, all invoked functions

                      imported.  If no filenames are specified, all functions
                      called are assumed to be unknown. This is the default
                      when no user options are specified. The last explicit
                      specification for a function takes precedence.

                      small   A traceback table is generated with no name or
                              parameter information.
                              This is the default when -g is NOT specified.
          tune=<option>
                      Specifies the architecture system for which the
                      executable program is optimized.
